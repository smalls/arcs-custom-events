# arcs-custom-events

Pages to demonstrate embedding of arcs metadata within a page.

Currently, two interesting pages:

- [index.html](https://smalls.github.io/arcs-custom-events/index.html) is a
  sample page with no arcs metadata.
- [index-with-arcs.html](https://smalls.github.io/arcs-custom-events/index-with-arcs.html)
  is the same page, but with arcs metadata embedded (a custom schema type, a
  particle that consumes that, and a recipe importing both of those).
